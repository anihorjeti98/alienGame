# alienGame
Getting started I had to create a folder where I uploaded all the images of objects that I will be using. Then I had to import pygame and set up the scaffolding of the game. I also created the player and box objects as classes of images. I followed by drawing the sprites and creating a method to make the player walk and jump. Next was adding gravity and a collision detection method that prevents the player (alien) from going to coordinates overlapping with the walls, ceilings and boxes (prevents alien from going through these solid in-game items).  Also added a jumping animation that displays when the user jumps their alien and some extra steps were taken to refine the game.
